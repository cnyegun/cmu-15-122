- Data struct of hash tables 
- Implement a basic interface of dictionaries
- Library's interface vs library's implementation
- Some library requires some operation provided by user to work correctly
- ds and operations called `library`
  code that uses the library called `client`
- Hash dict is a complex library
	>Requires the client to supply code and functions
- Complex libraries consist of: - client interface
								- implementation
								- library interface
- The client can't see the implementation

- Structure : [client interface]  -> client need to define datatype/functions
			  [implementation]	  -> client can't see 
			  [library interface] -> functions that the library provide to client
