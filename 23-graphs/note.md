Graph use case:
    Map with distance
    Facebook friends

Two basic way to represent graphs: 
    1. Adjacent matrices
    2. Means of adjacency lists


1. Undirected Graphs
- A set of Vertices (nodes) + a set of Edges 
- Each edges connect two different nodes (not to itself)

2. Implicit Graphs
- Never explicitly constructed but remain in the way
that the problem is solved. Like sudoku solver.

3. Explicit Graphs and Graph Interface
- Represent the actual graphs with datatype
